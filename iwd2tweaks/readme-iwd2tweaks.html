  <p><strong> Version 2.2 - <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/#iwd2tweak">Check
        for the most recent version</a></strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is a collection of tweaks that have been assembled
    for Icewind Dale II. They were almost all made for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> by
    Idobek and CamDawg, and cannibalized by Andyr to work for
    Icewind Dale, and cannibalizated again by The Bigg to work
    for <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym>. It is
    a compilation of fixes, cosmetic changes, and tweaks. Some
    of these were fan requests, others are needed fixes, and
    others simply make dealing with the more irritating aspects
    of the game engine easier. Each component can be installed
    separately so the player can pick and choose only which ones
    they wish to install. </p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section"> Every component in this mod makes interactive
  changes and therefore should be compatible with other mods.
  If you want the tweaks that affect all items in the game to
  also alter items added by mods, such as the Unlimited Stacks,
  you'll need to install the Tweak Pack after the other mods.
  As much as possible, the various tweaks have been written to
  adjust content added by other mods.
  <p></p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    The Icewind Dale II Tweak Pack is packaged and installed
      with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
      is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install,
      simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions
      on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive
    using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly
    extracted, you should have a IWD2Tweaks folder and Setup-IWD2Tweaks.exe
    in your Icewind Dale II folder. To install, simply double-click
    Setup-IWD2Tweaks.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before
    extracting the new version. Please note that this mod is
    incompatible with Mod Organizer.</em> The Icewind Dale II
    Tweak Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your
    Icewind Dale folder. If properly extracted, you should have
    a IWD2Tweaks folder, Setup-IWD2Tweaks, and IWD2Tweaks.command
    in your Icewind Dale folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>Setup-IWD2Tweaks.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
		Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from
		<a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least)
		the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G.
		/usr/bin).
		<br>Following that, open a terminal, cd to your IWD2 installation directory,
	run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries (*).
		<br>After that, run 'weinstall iwd2tweaks' from your IWD2
		installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.
  
		<br><br>*:
		You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it
		once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered,
	so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either
		if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file
		name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe
		bet.

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The tweak pack contains the following components that can
    be installed independently of one another.</p>
  <p><strong>Unlimited Ammo Stacks</strong><br />
    This tweak will adjust the maximum number of ammo--bullets,
      arrows, bolts, darts, throwing axes and throwing daggers--in
      a stack to 9,999. This component will affect <em>all</em> items
      in the game, including items introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Unlimited Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong><br />
    This tweak will adjust the maximum number of gems and jewelry
      in a stack to 9,999. This component will <em>not</em> affect
      magical rings or amulets. This component will affect <em>all</em> items
      in the game, including items introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Unlimited Potion Stacks</strong><br />
    This tweak will adjust the maximum number of potions in a
      stack to 9,999. This component will affect <em>all</em> items
      in the game, including items introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Unlimited Scroll Stacks</strong><br />
    This tweak will adjust the maximum number of scrolls in a
      stack to 9,999. This component will affect <em>all</em> items
      in the game, including items introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Bottomless Bags of Holding</strong><br />
    This component will alter every bag of holding to have unlimited
      capacity. Scroll cases, ammo belts, gem bags and the regular
      bags of holding will be changed. This component will not
      affect what you can place in the bags, just the capacity.
      This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game,
      including items introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Weapon Animation Tweaks</strong><br />
    By default, spears in Icewind Dale II use 33% overhead swings,
      33% backhand swings and only 34% thrusting attacks. Wouldn't
      it make more sense to use the pointy end?</p>
  <p>This component adjusts the attack animation balances of
    three weapons classes: spears, staves, and short swords.
    Spears and short swords now primarily use thrusting attacks
    and staves are more consistent as a class and use more swinging
    attacks. This component also changes morningstars to use
    a mace animation when attacking, instead of the flail-like
    ball-and-chain animation. Morningstars are depicted in inventory
    icons and description pictures as being closer to spiked
    maces. This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the
    game, including items introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Force All Dialogue to Pause</strong><br />
    This component will change all dialogue to pausing. No longer
      will bandits attack in the middle of a conversation. This
      component will affect <em>all</em> dialogues in the game,
      including ones introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Remove Helmet Animations</strong><br />
    I don't like how any of the helmets look on the character
      avatars. Now they can't be seen at all - just like ioun
      stones. This component will affect <em>all </em> helmets
      in the game, including helmets introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>100% Learn Spells</strong><br />
    With this component installed, the chance to successfully
      scribe mage spells to your spellbook will be set to 100%.
      However, even when set at 100% there is always a 1% chance
      of failure (similar to pickpocketing).</p>
  <p><strong>Stores Sell Larger Stacks of Items</strong><br />
    This component will alter all stores in the game to use higher
      stacks of arrows, bolts, bullets, darts, throwing axes
      and throwing daggers. This component will affect <em>all</em> stores
      in the game, including ones introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Staff, Club, and Sling Sellability</strong><br />
    This tweak will make shopkeepers purchase staves, clubs and
      slings in stores. Previously these items were unsellable.
      While selling them is certainly no quick way to find fortune,
      there was no good reason why you couldn't before! Cheers
      to Icelus for this component.</p>
  <p><strong>No Traps, Locks, or Detection Difficulty (Weimer)</strong><br />
    This cheat will make it so that there are no traps at all,
      chests can be always bashed, and invisible doors are always
      visible. Coding was taken (and adapted) from Weimer's version
      of the same component in Ease of Use for BGII. This component
      will affect <em>all</em> areas in the game, including ones
      introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Rest Anywhere</strong><br />
    This cheat allows you to rest in each and all areas. This
      component will affect <em>all</em> areas in the game, including
      ones introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Save Anywhere</strong><br />
    This cheat allows you to save in each and all areas. This
      component will affect <em>all</em> areas in the game, including
      ones introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Change Magically Created Weapons to Zero Weight</strong><br />
    Nearly all magically created items in <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> have
    zero weight, though there are a few exceptions. This component
    will change Shillegagh and Decastaff to have zero weight.
    This component will not affect items introduced by mods. </p>
  <p><strong>Maximum <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym> for
      Non-Party-Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong> <br />
    This component will alter creatures to have their theoretical
    maximum hit points. Creatures will get either a hit point
    total based on maximum hit dice rolls appropriate to their
    level, or their current hit point total--whichever is higher.
    This component will affect <em>all</em> creatures in the
    game, including creatures introduced by mods. Please note
    that this component will result in an harder game, since
    a number of enemies will have their <acronym title="Hit Points">HPs</acronym> doubled or even more;
    for example the goblins you face in Targos go from 4 to 10
    <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym>. </p>
  <p><strong>Gems and Potions Require Identification</strong><br />
    This component assigns a lore value to gems and potions,
      meaning that they now require identification. Lore value
      is calculated by an algorithm based on the value of the
      item, but smaller gems and lesser potions should still
      be fairly easy to identify by the party. Said algorithm
      was designed with Baldur's Gate II in mind, so it might
      be sub-optimal for Icewind Dale II. </p>
  <p><strong>Disable Portrait Icons Added by Equipped Items</strong><br />
    This component will prevent items from displaying the small
      icons (fire resistance, protection from charm) that appear
      on the character portrait while equipped. This will not
      affect the actual effects of the items, only the display
      of the icon. It will also not affect icons added by spells
      or other means. </p>
